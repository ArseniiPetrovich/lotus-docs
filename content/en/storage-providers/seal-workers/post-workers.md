While the Lotus Miner runs _windowPoSt_ and _winningPoSt_ by default, you can use specialized lotus workers to create a cluster of windowPoSt and winningPoSt workers to handle multiple Proof-of-Spacetime partitions simultaneously.

A lotus worker instance can only be one of the following:
- WindowPoSt worker
- WinningPoSt worker
- Worker for sealing tasks

## Launching PoSt workers

Before launching your PoSt workers you need to ensure that your meets the minial requirements for the task.

### Minminal spec requirements

| **Task**    | **GPU**            | **VRAM** | **RAM** |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| winningPoSt | Highly recommended |          |         |
| windowPoSt  | Highly recommended | 8\.5GiB  | 128GiB  |

### Remote storage access



### Environment variables

Ensure that workers have access to the following environment variables when they run. These are similar to those used by the Miner daemon ([explained in the setup guide]({{< relref "setup" >}})):

```
# MINER_API_INFO as obtained before
export TMPDIR=/fast/disk/folder3                    # used when sealing
export MINER_API_INFO:<TOKEN>:/ip4/<miner_api_address>/tcp/<port>/http`
export MARKETS_API_INFO:<TOKEN>:/ip4/<miner_api_address>/tcp/<port>/http`
export BELLMAN_CPU_UTILIZATION=0.875      # optimal value depends on exact hardware
export FIL_PROOFS_MAXIMIZE_CACHING=1
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_COLUMN_BUILDER=1 # when GPU is available
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_TREE_BUILDER=1   # when GPU is available
export FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE=/fast/disk/folder # > 100GiB!
export FIL_PROOFS_PARENT_CACHE=/fast/disk/folder2   # > 50GiB!
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_MULTICORE_SDR=1
```

### Run the PoSt worker

```shell
lotus-worker run <flags>
```

The above command will start the worker. YouÂ´ll need to specify which PoSt operation you want the worker to perform with one of the following flags set to true.

```
   --winningpost                 enable winning post (default: false)
   --windowpost                  enable window post (default: false)
```

When a winningPoSt or windowPoSt worker connects to the _lotus-miner_, the lotus miner will delegate all winningPoSt or windowPoSt tasks to that worker. If both tasks are delegated to seperate PoSt workers, no PoSt tasks will be executed locally on the miner instance. If a worker is stopped, lotus-miner switches back to local PoSt automatically.

You can verify that PoSt workers are connected to the lotus-miner with `lotus-miner proving workers`:

```shell
$ lotus-miner proving workers
Worker 0, host computer
        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use
        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB
        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB

Worker 1, host othercomputer
        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use
        RAM:  [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/119.2 GiB
        VMEM: [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/119.2 GiB
        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used
```

You can also verify that PoSt workers are connected in the workers-section of `lotus-miner info`.

```shell
$ lotus-miner info
Workers:
	Seal: 15
	WdPoSt: 4
	WinPoSt: 3
```

### Optional settings

Although the default settings are reasonable you can configure some advanced settings when running the PoSt workers, that can be tested for local optimizations of your hardware.

```
   --post-parallel-reads value   maximum number of parallel challenge reads (0 = no limit) (default: 0)
```

Lets you set an upper boundary of how many challenges it reads from your storage simultaneously. At defualt this is set to no limit, meaning that it will try to read all challenges at the same time from your storage.

```
   --post-read-timeout value     time limit for reading PoSt challenges (0 = no limit) (default: 0s)
```

Lets you set a cut off time for reading challenges from storage, after which it will abort the job. At default this is set to no limit.
