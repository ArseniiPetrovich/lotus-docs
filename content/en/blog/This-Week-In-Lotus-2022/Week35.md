:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

:rocket: **Upcoming features/enhancements:**

- *Sealing-as-a-service:* A lot of work towards [supporting partially sealed sectors imports](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9210) happened this week, but there are still quite a lot to do. So by end of next week something mergeable that can be reviewed might be ready.
- *Redundant chain nodes:*
- A `lotus info` command is [currently in review](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9233), it gathers a lot of nice high level node status and metrics in one place.

**Bug fixes:**
- A PR to ensure that the connection between Boost and Lotus-workers computing DataCids where closed correctly where merged.
- A fix to ensure that the MAX_CONCURRENT environment variable for DataCid tasks is being enforced has been fixed.
- Some smaller UX-improvements where also merged, like adding a better Ledger rejection error, and ability to specify the message sender in the lotus-miner actor set-addrs command.

**Protocol development:**
- In Lotus we are getting ready to implement FIP0029 - Beneficiary address for SPs, you can track the open work items here.

**SplitStoreV2:** We are tracking a potential issue where no automatic pruning is happening when ColdStoreType is set to universal and  EnableColdStoreAutoPrune = true.

FIL Lisbon now has a website, it will take place from Oct 30 - Nov 4, and the Lotus team will host a Lotus & Friends day on the 2nd of November. We will come back with an exact agenda and place later :smile:


ThatÂ´s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
